    "description":"Make a claim to 1ACRE of land for a off-grid building site and regenerative agriculture/forestry experiments. Can be combined with other 1ACRE Claims to create larger than 1 acre land claim. REGEN Nations offers a capped number of 1ACRE Claim NFTs for each property.
1ACRE Claim NFT holders are able to make a claim to use 1 acre site on the property the NFT is connected to. The NFT offers the ability to build an off-grid home as approved by the county of origins. 1ACRE Claim NFTs holders can visit the claimed acre anytime, and can do regenerative agriculture and forestry experiments on the claimed area. 1ACRE Claim NFTs are not claims of ownership of the property, they are rights to use the property and encumber one square acre of land on a property owned by REGEN Nations. 1ACRE Claim NFT holders can stay on the one acre property they claim 365 days a year. The right of control is your right to use or control the use of the property. This could include things like making renovations or changes to the property, having guests over to visit or live with you or renting it out to earn an income. The right of enjoyment gives you the right to lawfully enjoy your property how you see fit. For example, you can choose to throw a party at your claim – provided you don’t break any local noise ordinances.",
